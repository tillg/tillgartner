All you senior Textmate users forgive me for my childish enthusiasm, BUT: It’s just great!

TextMate, the workhorse editor on Mac has a blogging bundle I just discovered. If you are curioud, [this movie] explains it in a really decent way. Although it’s 6 years old (!!) it’s still valid and very handy.
