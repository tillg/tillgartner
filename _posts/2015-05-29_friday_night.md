Ok, it’s Friday night, the hard work part of my stay in Da Nang is mostly done – so I hit the road for a bar hopping tour. 

Dinner on the road: street food along the beach (Nadine, Doreen, Hamarz, you know the place). What’s new: ordering became easy by now. Not that I speak a relevant word of Vietnamese but I got used to the fact that I don’t ;)

Then it’s about 8. Too early for bars. So I decide a haircut is due…

This is my crazy hairdresser:

Then I have a beer at Red Sky Bar.

Either I’m too early or the bar is not hip anymore: too few people and the wrong ones…

Then I have to visit my friend San: she is a lovely Vietnamese girl that promotes San Miguel beer in the bars of Da Nang. And she Vibered me the pic of her new outfit:

So my bike & me drive to Bamboo bar: a bar in Bach Dang where older Westerners pick up Vietnamese girls and where every sport channel has a screen.  I have a San Miguel Light and watch Federer win in Roland Garos. 

Bar hopping means you have to keep moving. Next stop: a dancing event at the border of the Han river.

For those who know: like Lido or the dancing club down in Hofbräu-Keller. Playing with Vietnamese kids & families, veerry nice atmosphere. 

Next I happen to drive by a place with a sign stating it’s a “Beer garden”. So must stop – that means parking the bike (like in every place here).:

As it turns out, a Vietnamese beer garden is a different concept than a German one: it’s more like a disco where they also serve beer...

Remember: DJs in hip locations are always girls in Vietnam! 

The disco sound feels good. So why not go to a place that I know and that has good (loud) music? On top of Novotel there is the in-famous SkyBar.

So: parking the bike, going to the elevator that leads to floor #57 – “Sorry Sir, we have a strict policy: no shorts”.

Tough luck. 

So I finish the evening in one of my “standards”, the [Minsk Bar](http://danangplaces.com/2015/10/07/minsk-bar/). Close by the hotel, very laid back, reggae music.

But since it’s Friday evening, the end is not the end yet. Back at the hotel, 1 more of their Whiskey sours:

 As I’m typing this, I’ve had 3 of them and it’s past 23:00. And tomorrow I am meeting the guys of the local Java Developers Club. And before that I plan to swim & run on the beach – so: Go to bed, Till!

Although there are no pics: I met about 10 new people, 50/50 Vietnamese & foreigners. It’s the super-communicative country!
