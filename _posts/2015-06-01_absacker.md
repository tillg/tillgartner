Tonight I learned a new thing: Vietnamese also have Fast Food. Like McDonaldViet. My showed me such a place tonight. It’s called Star Beef. Believe it or not, we had something like a “Hot Stone” menu. Except that the stone was metal. 

The lady that served the beef was cutting it in little pieces in front of us, with scissors.
