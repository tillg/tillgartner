*** This post is work in progress ***

Some time ago I started playing around with ststic website generators. I was looking for a website generator that uses a programming language that I wanted tlo use / learn. Therefore I ended up working with [METALSMITH](https://metalsmith.io/). But time passed on, and I realized I was spending more time with the generation process than with writing stuff for the website...

Therefore I changed my criteria and decided to go with the flow and use what all the internet seems to use - and where I would expect a large ecosystem of templates and tools: [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

So here is my stack as it looks today:

* I use [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* The static site is generated with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* I use the [TeXt theme](https://tianqi.name/jekyll-TeXt-theme/), and configured it.

What I have done so far:

* I set up tollgartner with the new Jekyll TeXt theme
* I fixed my old posts so they render properly with Jekyll
* I configured TeXt so it looks more the way I like it.


This is my little ToDo list:

* Fix the problem of inline pictures in blog entries not being displayed
* Add Google trackinbg and ideally have a report of the site usage available to the site readers...
* Migrate the recipes as collection
* Move to my URL http://tillgartner.com
* Learn about fixed URLs for posts so they can be referenced
* Add comments
* Posts that have a cover image should show it on the blog post overview page (aka home page)
* Make a collection _softwareWeNeed_
