A really helpful resource I found yesterday:

[The Art of Command Line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line/blob/master/README.md)

Not only does it list tips that you often need, but it also gives you hints and advices on how you should work, what you should read, what you should learn (indicating a certain order). 

For an occasional command liner like me that's great!
