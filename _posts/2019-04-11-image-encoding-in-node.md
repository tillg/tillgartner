**This article is work in progress!**


While programming on a side project, I had to deal with images in a node application. My application is using [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) as well as [Pouchdb](https://pouchdb.com/).

I was dealing with different sources & targets:
* A user uploads a picture
* I read a picture from file, be it in JPEG or PNG format
* I send a picture to AWS
* I store a picture in my pouchDB

While browsing the different sources, I encountered various formats on how images can be handled in node:

* As buffer containing binary data
* As string conatining Base64 encoded data, starting with something like `data:image/jpeg;base64,` (or with `png`)
* As string containing base64 encoded data without the special beginning

These are the different operations I am doing and what they provide as output:
* Reading a file from disk with `fs`: return a `Buffer`with binary data
* 

These are the sources and targets in/from which image data is transferred in my example:
