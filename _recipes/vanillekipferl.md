This receipe is from Katja, and her Kipferl are the world best ones.

Translated that would be:

- 60g icing sugar
- 90g grounded almonds
- 150g butter
- 100g corn starch
- 100g flour
- Vanilla iced sugar for covering

You mix it all (except the vanilla iced sugar) with your hands to get a nice dough. Put it in the fridge for 1/2 hour. Then make little dough balls and shape them to become half moon cookies. It all goes in the oven at 200 degrees until they are golden brown. Depending on the size of the cookies and the oven it should take 8-10 minutes.
When the cookies are still warm, roll them in vanilla iced sugar.

This is what you want them to look like
