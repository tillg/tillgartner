# April 13th 2019

While being in Hongkong, I set up my new site with jekyll.

problems I was facing or things that I just spent time on:

* I didn't like the font on the color of the links as they were displayed by the TeXt theme, so I had to dig in the CSS - as soon as you go CSS at least one hour is wasted...
