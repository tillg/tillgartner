title: To Do
---

This is my little ToDo list:

* Fix the problem of inline pictures in blog entries not being displayed
* Migrate the recipes as collection
* Move to my URL http://tillgartner.com
* Add Google trackinbg and ideally have a report of the site usage available to the site readers...
* Change favicon to till logo - or make a new logo...
* Learn about fixed URLs for posts so they can be referenced
* Add comments
* Posts that have a cover image should show it on the blog post overview page (aka home page)
* Make a collection _softwareWeNeed_
* Have the last build date & time displayed in the footer of the pages.
* Have the generated site be automatically checked for broken links
